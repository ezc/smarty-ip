Change Log:
 8 Aug 2011 - fix a document bug
 7 Aug 2011 - add user-config feature
 6 Aug 2011 - Separate config code and function code
 5 Aug 2011 - Rebuild this programe,Separate some function can be used in other programes
 5 Aug 2011 - First Release


Commentary:
 this programe is a subset of smarty-package, To use this, just put/replace it in smarty-package path. NOTE smarty-package must be added in your load-path.  When you add smary-package,it will auto load it.
 To load smarty-package,use this in your .emacs file.
   (load "smarty")

configure file:
 If you install versions of smarty-ip in different languages.You MUST clean old language files ,the location is
 smarty-package-path/configure/smarty-ip-*.el
If you custom configure name ,it should be your custom-name
 smarty-package-path/`smarty-configure'/smarty-ip-*.el

currently,it only support chinese and english. but you can config which you use.

 - copy smarty-package-path/`smarty-configure'/smarty-ip-en.el to smarty-ip-local.el
 - edit smarty-ip-local.el file.


functions you may want to use:
M-x smarty-ip-interactive
    get ip-info by interacting with the system.the simplest way to get ip but I don't recommend you use it directly.you should use this `smarty-ip'
M-x smarty-ip
   `smarty-ip-interactive' advanced version,if user active mark,the programe will try to search region,if not,it will be try to search current-point to line-end.


FAQ:
- Q:The API address provided by smarty-ip can not satisfy my requirement.How to use other ip location API?
  A:Absolutely,itâ€™s OK. You just need to do as the following steps:
    Access the path smarty-configure,e.g:
       cd ~/.emacs.d/smarty/configure/
    based on a basic language,e.g:
       cp smarty-ip-en.el smarty-ip-local.el
    clear up the existent language package,e.g:
       rm smarty-ip-en.el
- Q:What is "smarty-package" mentioned many times in the article?
  A:Smarty-package is extention of emacs.
    I planned to release it after all the tool package being packed up.
    But these days our company are holding a programme contest
    and smarty-ip is the production of this contest. So I release it ahead of schedule .


ToDo:
- add replace ip to city in buffer
- extend return-message format, let it can allow user-define.
- allow translate the result to user-prefer
